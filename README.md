# PicMap

PicMap is a website which purpose is to connect memories around the world, using media elements related by where they were captured. The application should let a user upload pictures pin-pointing the location where they were taken, offering them album features and cool profile-network characteristics: they could connect with people regarding places or picture themesâ€™ interests, like, dislike, and comment. It would be also nice if they could connect to other social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Snapchat; but so far it would be a
plus.

Target Users: Any person who enjoys taking pictures and sharing with others around the world.
